# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For this assignment I created a work day calendar. This allows you to save events from 9AM - 5PM. The events are saved to local storage.

This app uses the Luxon library to get the current date and current time.

## Demo

The following GIF demonstrates the application functionality:

A time slot will be color coded based on whether the event is in the past (Grey), present (Red), or future (Green).
